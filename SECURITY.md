## Reporting a Vulnerability

Despite this being primarily a learning project I appreciate any security vulnerability reports.
Please report all vulnerabilities [here](https://github.com/igorplebanczyk/asteroids-game/security/advisories/new).
If you have suggestions on how to fix them please open a pull request as well.
I will fix all vulnerabilities as soon as possible.
